# Bubble Sort

- In-place algorithm - we're logically partitioning the array, we don't have to create another array in order to perform the sort
- O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity - quadratic
- It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items, 10,000 steps to sort 100 items, 1,000,000 steps to sort 1000 items
- Algorithm degrades quickly
