- There can be many implementations of the same algorithm

## Introduction to Big O Notation

It measures the number of steps an algorithm takes to resolve
as the number of items increases.

Notations from best to worse.

| Big-O            |             |
|------------------|-------------|
| O(1)             | Constant    |
| O(logn)          | Logarithmic |
| O(n)             | Linear      |
| O(n<sup>2</sup>) | Quadratic   |
